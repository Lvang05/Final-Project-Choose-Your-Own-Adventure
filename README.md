About the Story

Whispers of Black Hollow is a chilling interactive horror experience that lets you choose the path â€” and the consequence. Across 12 dark scenes, you'll uncover an ancient curse, confront spectral truths, and decide whether to embrace your legacy or destroy it.

It begins with a mysterious letter, seemingly from your dead grandfather. You're drawn into Black Hollow, a place erased from history, where time, memory, and self unravel in terrifying ways.
