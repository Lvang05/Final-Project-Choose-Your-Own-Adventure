# 👻 Whispers of Black Hollow
It started with a letter - handwritten in ink that smelled of ash, sealed with a name that should’ve stayed in the ground. Your grandfather’s name. But he’s been dead for nearly a decade.

The letter calls you to Black Hollow, a village wiped from all records, its name scratched out of history like a curse. It’s a place no map shows and no local dares to speak of. A place where the trees lean too close, and the shadows don’t follow the rules of light.

Driven by a mix of curiosity, dread, and something you can’t explain - you go.

But Black Hollow isn’t just a place. 

It’s a memory. A wound. A gate.

And it’s been waiting for you.

You will choose.

You will uncover.

You will either escape with the truth…
Or become part of the whispering woods forever.
