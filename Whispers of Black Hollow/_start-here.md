# ðŸ‘» Whispers of Black Hollow
It started with a letter â€” handwritten in ink that smelled of ash, sealed with a name that shouldâ€™ve stayed in the ground. Your grandfatherâ€™s name. But heâ€™s been dead for nearly a decade.

The letter calls you to Black Hollow, a village wiped from all records, its name scratched out of history like a curse. Itâ€™s a place no map shows and no local dares to speak of. A place where the trees lean too close, and the shadows donâ€™t follow the rules of light.

Driven by a mix of curiosity, dread, and something you canâ€™t explain â€” you go.

But Black Hollow isnâ€™t just a place. 

Itâ€™s a memory. A wound. A gate.

And itâ€™s been waiting for you.

You will choose.

You will uncover.

You will either escape with the truthâ€¦
Or become part of the whispering woods forever.
