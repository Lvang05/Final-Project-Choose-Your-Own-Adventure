# 🎉 Ending: A New Spark

You fire — and the shot lands true. A chain reaction erupts inside the station. You pull away just in time.

The battle station explodes in a brilliant blaze of light. The Dominion has lost its ultimate weapon.

Back at base, the rebels cheer. The cloaked woman smiles. The Spark is alive… and the fight has only begun.

> ⭐ You’ve sparked a rebellion.
