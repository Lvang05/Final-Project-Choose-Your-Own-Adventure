# 🌠 Scene 3D: Lights in the Sky

You sneak out that night and climb a nearby ridge. In the distance, streaks of fire dance across the sky — something just crash-landed in the canyon.

As you get closer, you find a smoldering escape pod. The droid is gone.

But you do find part of a broken recording:

> “...Old Ken... the plans… must not fall into...”

Suddenly, a shadow looms behind you — a cloaked scavenger!
