# ⚔️ Scene 4A: The Way of the Spark

Old Ken begins your training. You learn to feel the energy that flows through all living things — the Spark.

> “The Spark is what gives us strength. A connection… a guide.”

He also tells you of the Dominion’s planet-killing battle station and the rebel fighters trying to stop it.

Soon, a distress call arrives: the cloaked woman has been captured. The Dominion is headed for her homeworld next.
