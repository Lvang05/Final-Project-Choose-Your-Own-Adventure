# 🏃 Scene 4B: Second Thoughts

You panic and bolt from Old Ken’s cave, running until your lungs burn. But when you return home… it’s too late.

Troopers in white armor have razed the farm. Your family is gone. The droid, missing.

You fall to your knees. This wasn’t just some message — this was war.

Old Ken appears behind you.

> “There’s no going back. But there is a path forward.”
