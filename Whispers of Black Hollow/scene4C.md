# 💥 Scene 4C: Fight the Scavengers

You draw a makeshift blaster and take a wild shot. One scavenger goes down, but the rest close in.

Just as you're about to be overwhelmed — a burst of light! A glowing energy blade cuts through the air.

Old Ken emerges from the rocks and drives the scavengers away.

> “Not bad,” he smirks. “But next time, try calling for help first.”
