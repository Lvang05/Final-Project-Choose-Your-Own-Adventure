# 🚀 Scene 5A: To the Rebellion

You and Old Ken find a rogue pilot and his hairy co-pilot at a grimy spaceport. They agree to fly you off-world — for a price.

As Dominion forces close in, you escape in their modified freighter, barely dodging laser fire.

> “Hang on, kid!” the pilot shouts. “Next stop: rebel command.”
