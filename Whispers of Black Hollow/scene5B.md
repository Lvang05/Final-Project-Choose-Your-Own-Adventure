# 🏃‍♂️ SCENE 5B - Nowhere to Run
You turn and run.

Branches tear at your sleeves.
The gate vanishes behind the trees.

You glance over your shoulder-
he’s gone.

You slow.
Breathe.
Then turn back.

He’s right in front of you.
No eyes.
No space between.
>“Found you.”

## ❌ GAME OVER
You didn’t run fast enough.
You never could.
