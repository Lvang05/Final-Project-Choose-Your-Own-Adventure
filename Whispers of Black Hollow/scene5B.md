# 🧘 Scene 5B: Training Delay

You ask Old Ken for more time to train. He agrees, but warns: “The Spark grows stronger in action.”

That night, he receives word: the cloaked woman has been captured. The Dominion’s battle station is on the move — and it’s heading for her homeworld.

You can’t wait any longer.
