# 🏠 SCENE 5E - Going Home
You leave the station.
The file's gone.
The case is closed.

You arrive home.
Lights on. Doors locked.
Safe.

Until you see a shadow that shouldn't be there.
It moves.
You don’t.

## ❌ GAME OVER
The Hollow didn't need to drag you back.
It waited in your walls.
Now it wears your skin.
