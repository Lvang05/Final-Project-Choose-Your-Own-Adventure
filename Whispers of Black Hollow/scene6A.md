# 🚪 SCENE 6A - The Gate Opens
The key turns.

The gate exhales.

Beyond it: a pale, twitching forest.
No wind. No sky. Just waiting.

Then -
your own voice whispers behind you:
>"Go on. It’s already inside you."

You’re alone.

## What do you do?

- 🧍 [Step through the gate](./scene7A.md)

- 🪓 [Turn around and seal it shut](./scene7B.md)
