# 🔓 Scene 6C: Solo Rescue

You break into the prison wing alone and free the cloaked woman. But you’re cornered by an armored figure with a red energy blade — the Masked Enforcer.

Old Ken arrives just in time. The two clash, blades humming in the darkness.

> “Run,” he says. “You’re the spark now.”
